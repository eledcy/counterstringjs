# CounterString JS

An Example of creating a CounterString tool in JavaScript.

Initially created as a "Snippet" run from chrome dev tools.

The source for this is in the `\snippets` directory.

Then the Snippet was converted into a simple Chrome Extension.

See the `extension` folder.

## Detailed Description

A simple CounterString generator, which displays a dialog asking for the number of characters.

Then generates a CounterString to the dev console and inserts the counterstring into the value of the field to support testing online forms.

- code is on github as this is an example
- right click context menu only enabled on input fields
